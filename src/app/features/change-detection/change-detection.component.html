<h2>Change Detection</h2>
<div class="wrapper">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Angular Runs a change detection cycle whenever any state gets changed or
      any event is triggered.
    </li>
    <li>
      This is really important as it helps us to keep our template and class
      file in sync with each other.
    </li>
    <li>
      Change detection can happen either by two ways :
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>default</strong> : Here change detection will run for all the
          changes and it might hamper the performance. Example : If change
          detection cycle runs on the app component then all the child
          component's change detection cycle will also run.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>OnPush</strong> : By using OnPush statergy change detection
          for the component will only work under the following circumstances :
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the input properties are changed and that also reference of the
              input properties got changed.
            </li>
            <li>Any change occured in the child.</li>
            <li>Subscribing to an observable.</li>
            <li>Or manually using change detection methods.</li>
          </ul>

          Methods of changeDetectorRef :
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Detach</strong> : It will detach the change detection
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reattach</strong> : It will reattach the change detection
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>DetectChange</strong> : Here we will be able to detect
              changes even if the change detection is detached.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Zone js</strong> : It refers to a context that helps manage and
      track asynchronous operations. They are used to automatically trigger
      change detection whenever any asyn event occur.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Zone.js</strong> : It is a library that provides execution
      contexts(zones) which are responsible for handling change detection by
      events from async operations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>NgZone</strong> : It is a service which provides functionalities
      to manually handle zones, add something in the zone or remove something
      out of it.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="text" />
  Text is: {{ text }}
  <button (click)="reattach()">Reattach change detection</button>
