  <h2>Angular JSON</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Note</strong> : When we use ng new we create a angular workspace
      which contains a default application my-app.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>$schema</strong> :
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is used for defining definition and structure for rest of the
          current JSON file.
        </li>
        <li>It is used to validate the structure of angular file.</li>
        <li>
          It ensures that the configuration file is valid and accoding to
          Angular CLI's schema.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>version</strong> : Used to maintain the version of angular.json
      schema.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>newProjectRoot</strong> :
      <ul>
        <li>
          It contains the default root folder where new applications/libraries
          will be placed.
        </li>
        <li>It only effects the future applications/libraries.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>projects</strong> :
      <ul>
        <li>It contains the list of projects created in the new workspace.</li>
        <li>
          It is an object where key is project name and value is project
          configuration.
        </li>
        <li>Against each project we will have the following properties.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>projectType</strong> : It states whether the current project
          is an application or library.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>schematics</strong> :
          <ul>
            <li>
              These are templates or blueprints that help automate tasks like
              creating components, services, modules, etc. They are built-in or
              custom templates used to generate code, configure projects, or
              modify project files in an Angular workspace.
            </li>
            <li>
              These configurations specify the options that control how Angular
              CLI commands, such as ng generate or ng add, behave when
              generating or modifying components, services, or other elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Angular CLI has a set of built-in schematics for generating
              different project parts, such as components, services, directives,
              modules, etc. You can customize the default behavior of these
              schematics by defining options in angular.json.
            </li>
            <li>
              skipTest true : means ng g c command will not generate the spec
              files.
            </li>
            <li>
              In short these can be used to control the angular cli command or
              add some default behaviour to the components generated using
              angular cli like style sheet : scss , or change detection statergy
              onPush, etc
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>root</strong> :
          <ul>
            <li>Base path of the app.</li>
            <li>Empty means root of the workspace.</li>
            <li>
              It its blank means the project is present in root of workspace.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>sourceRoot</strong> : Means the root of the src folder.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>prefix</strong> : Used to specify prefix of component
          selectors. In our case it is app. We can set it to something else.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>architect</strong> : It contains the build, serve, test, i18,
          etc configurations.

                    builder:{{ "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser" }}
                  </strong>
                  : Defines how the build process should be done. The value here
                  is a npm package which contains various builders. The builder
                  is responsible for the build process of the project.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>options</strong>: Contains outputPath, index, main,
                  pollyfills, tsconfig, assets, styles, scripts, etc. These are
                  the entry points for the application. When the build will be
                  generated these entry points will be used to generate the
                  final bundle.
                </li>

                  <strong>configurations</strong> : It contains production,
                  development configurations. These production and development
                  configurations contains instructions for
                  fileReplacements,budgets,hashing,etc.
